        <p>I worked with a friend to create a web application that enables Spotify users to find random songs and discover new music they would have otherwise never have been <br/>
            recommended. We used Node.js (Express) on the back-end and Bootstrap on the front-end to create a responsive user interface!</p>

        <p>I am currently developing an mobile application that displays the UCLA Dining Hall menus in a user-friendly mobile app. I am currently exploring different methods of <br/>
            retrieving the data that needs to be displayed which includes using an existing API or web scraping the website for relevant data.</p>
            <!-- Unfortunately, Covid-19 has made completing this application more challenging as all the UCLA Dining Halls are not open and so the API naturally-->

        <p>I joined my friends to participate in IDEA Hacks, the largest hardware hackathon on the West Coast. I ideated and worked with my teammates to create Power Shower, <br/>
            an IoT hub that encourages college students to conserve water usage when taking showers in dorms. Power Shower helps students monitor how long they spend in showers <br/>
            and encourages them to decrease their water consumption using a mobile app. We were fortunate enough to be awarded the runner-ups for the Sustainability category of <br/>
            the hackathon.</p>

        <p>Electric skateboards are fun but they're rather expensive. In my senior year of high school, I worked with a friend to create a cost-efficient electric skateboard.<br/> 
            We learned to use machine shop tools such as band saws and scroll saws to carve out our own deck from a slab of wood. The skateboard has a single brushless <br/> 
            motor wired to a microcontroller which was able to communicate with a remote controller. The skateboard has a top speed of about 15-20 mph based on the weight <br/>
            of the rider. The final price of our skateboard was about $300 which is pretty good considering similar reliable products we didn't wholesale purchase our parts <br/>
            and similar products on the market generally go for above $500.</p>
